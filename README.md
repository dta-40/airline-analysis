# Airline Analysis

This repository contains my implementation of Codecademy's **Airline Analysis** project, but built the way I would do it in a real data science / data engineering workflow:

- Using **VS Code** (not the Codecademy in-browser editor)
- Using a **Python script** (not just a Jupyter notebook)
- Versioned with **git + GitHub**
- Structured with separate folders for data and notebooks
